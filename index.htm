        <a href=""> The Ugly Duckling</a>That summer the country was particularly beautiful, 
        and it was glorious to be out in the green fields and meadows. 
        It was so amusing to see the white stork parading around on his long red legs and to hear him talking Egyptian,
        a language he had learned from his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the midst of the sunny meadow stood an old farmhouse.
        It was surrounded by a deep canal, and from the walls down to the water
        grew burdock shrubs so tall that children could stand under them. It was so nice and shady 
        there that a mother duck decided it would be a good place
        to sit on her nest and hatch out her young ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        At last one of the eggs cracked open, and then another and another until eight new little yellow 
        ducklings poked out their heads and cried “Peep! Peep!”
